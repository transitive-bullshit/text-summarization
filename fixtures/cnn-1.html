<p><strong>(CNN)</strong> -- At least one person was killed as a 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck Monday morning in southern Mexico's Chiapas state near the border with Guatemala, authorities in Chiapas said.</p>

<p>The quake happened at 6:23 a.m. (7:23 a.m. ET), about 1 mile from Puerto Madero, Mexico, which is on the country's Pacific coast.</p>

<p>Strong shaking was felt in southern Chiapas state and western Guatemala, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.</p>

<p>In the Chiapas town of Huixtla, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) to the north of the epicenter, a person died after a wall fell on him, Chiapas' state civil protection system said on Twitter on Monday.</p>

<p>The quake damaged part of an airport in Tapachula, a Mexican city of about 300,000 people near the Guatemala border. Lights hung precariously by wires, and debris littered a floor, pictures that the city government posted to Twitter show.</p>

<p>The epicenter was about 127 miles (204 kilometers) west of Guatemala's capital, Guatemala City.</p>

<p>The depth of the quake was 37 miles, the USGS said. The USGS initially said the magnitude was 7.1.</p>
